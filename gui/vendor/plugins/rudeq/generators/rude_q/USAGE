Description:
    The rude_q generator creates a fully functioning RudeQ.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, an RSpec spec in
    spec/models, database fixtures in spec/fixtures/plural_name.yml, and a migration
    in db/migrate.

    All the generated files are fully functioning, and no extra work should be necessary.

Example:
    ./script/generate rude_q ProcessQueue

    This will create a ProcessQueue model:
        Model:      app/models/process_queue.rb
        Spec:       spec/models/process_queue_spec.rb
        Fixtures:   spec/fixtures/process_queues.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_process_queues.rb

    Run migrations, and you can use it immediately;
        ProcessQueue.set(queue_name, value)
        ProcessQueue.get(queue_name)
