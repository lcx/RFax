= Nifty Generators

An extended verison of the collection of useful Rails generator scripts created by
ryanb http://github.com/ryanb/nifty-generators adding improved controller tests when
using Shoulda (http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda), support for using factory_girl
(http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) to provide the test fixtures, and support
for the generation of formtastic (http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic/) powered
forms in the views.

== Install

Available only as a plugin.

To use in a single rails app:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/iceburging/nifty-generators.git

To make available to all rails apps:

  ~/.rails/generators install git://github.com/iceburging/nifty-generators.git

== Usage

If you run script/generate without any additional arguments you should see the
available generators listed.

To run the generator, go to your rails project directory and call it
using the script/generate or script/destroy command.

  script/generate nifty_scaffold Recipe name:string index new

== Extended Features

=== Shoulda

Simply use the nifty_scaffold generator with the +--shoulda+ option as before.
The controller tests will now test assignment, response, template rendering and
the flash status.

  script/generate nifty_scaffold --shoulda Recipe name:string

=== Factory Girl

Use the the nifty_scaffold generator with the +--factory_girl+ option to create
a factory.rb file in test/ (if using Test::Unit or Shoulda) or spec/ (if using RSpec)
and use factory_girl to provide the test fixtures.

  script/generate nifty_scaffold --factory_girl Recipe name:string

If the factory.rb file already exists then the new Factory will be appended to the end
of the file.

=== Formtastic

Use the the nifty_scaffold generator with the +--formtastic+ option to generate
formtastic code for the forms in the new and edit views.

  script/generate nifty_scaffold --formtastic Recipe name:string

When using the formtastic option you will need to make sure that you have installed the
formtastic gem, generated the formtastic stylesheets, and added them to your application.rb
layout file before running the application.

=== Compatability

The +--factory_girl+ and +--formtastic+ options should work alongside the other
options. Notably they can be used with both the +--haml+ and +--RSpec+ options.

== Included Generators

* nifty_layout: generates generic layout, stylesheet, and helper files.
* nifty_scaffold: generates a controller and optional model/migration.
* nifty_config: generates a config YAML file and loader.
* nifty_authentication: generates user model with sign up and log in.

To view the README for each generator, run it with the +--help+ option.

  script/generate nifty_layout --help


== Troubleshooting and FAQs

<b>I get "undefined method 'title'" error.</b>

Try running nifty_layout, that will generate this helper method. Or
you can just change the templates to whatever approach you prefer for
setting the title.


<b>I can't set new attributes in my model.</b>

Add the attribute to the attr_accessible line in the model.


<b>I get "undefined method 'root_url'" error.</b>

Some generators default redirecting to the root_url. Set this in your
routes.rb file like this (substituting your controller name).

  map.root :controller => 'foo'


<b>I get a missing database error.</b>

Run <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>.


<b>I get a routing error when I try to submit a form.</b>

Try restarting your development server. Sometimes it doesn't detect the
change in the routing.


<b>The tests/specs don't work.</b>

Make sure you have mocha installed and require it in your spec/test helper.

  gem install mocha

  # in spec_helper.rb
  config.mock_with :mocha

  # in test_helper.rb
  require 'mocha'

Also, make sure you're using Rails 2.1 or greater.

forking the project and modifying to your heart's content.
